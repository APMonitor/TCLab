    "# The Labtime Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Labtime` class is a tool for speeding up the simulation of process control experiments. With this tool you can more quickly develop control algorithms through simulation, then apply the algorithms to the Temperature Control Lab device with minimal changes to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases you do not need to directly invoke `Labtime`. For example, `setup` with the optional parameter `speedup` (described in the chapter _TCLab Simulation for Offline Use_) uses `Labtime` to adjust the operation of the `clock` iterator. This is sufficient for many applications."
